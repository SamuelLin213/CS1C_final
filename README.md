### Doxygen
In order to use Doxygen, cd to project directory in the cmd,
and then run the 'doxygen' command. It will use the doxyfile
configurations to generate the html and latex for our project.

The doxygen latex output is ignored automatically using the 
.gitignore file since its just the output and its easy to generate.

To open the html, go to the generated html folder, and click on 
'index.html'
